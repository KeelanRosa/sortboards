# Sortboards
Experimental drag-and-drop notecard app. Made with [Mavo](https://mavo.io/) and includes Markdown support.

For anyone who wants to try it I've set up a [working demo](https://keelanrosa.github.io/sortboards.html).

To use: 
* Download files
* Change the [mv-storage value in sortboards.html to something actually useful](https://mavo.io/docs/storage/) (Current default mv-storage value is... here. That is not the storage value you're looking for.)
* Rest is probably self-explanatory. Add boards, add cards, drag & drop to sort as desired.
